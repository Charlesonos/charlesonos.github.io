## Welcome
- Hello there! Welcome to my site.

This website is my personal potfolio to showcase the litte progress i am making in my Cyber security study program and some courses that i am taking here at GVSU. 
CIS 641 (System Analysis and Design) is one of the courses i am cureently taking.
I and my team members are currently embarking on a project to buld a web based book searching tool. It's an open source website that will be designed to help people (especially sudents) to search for books, add to personal list if they are logged into the system. This tool will really be helpful to people who find it difficult to get FREE books to read. We hope to generate income from the traffic. People will be able to advertise their contents by paying a token to get their ads diplayed.This is what we intend to achive. We beleive it is great project. What do you think?
